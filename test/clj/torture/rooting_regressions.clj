;; Allocation-every-1 regressions for the rooting gaps closed on 2026-09-25
;; (ADR-0197 shape: the launcher supplies CLJW_GC_TORTURE_ALLOC=1, the
;; assertions live here). Each case failed under alloc torture before its fix.

;; Alloc torture only collects inside a live VM eval, so analysis-time cases
;; run through `eval`: analysis of a plain top-level form is never collected.

;; eval: the eval'd form's chunks lived in a per-call arena freed on return, so
;; a fn it def'd traced freed constant pools at the next collect.
