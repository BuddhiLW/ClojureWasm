;; harness.suites — where the cljw-native suite tier IS, as data.
;;
;; One definition, two projections: `test/clj/run_suites.clj` runs it as the
;; gate step `test_clj_suites`, and `dev/user.clj` runs it from a warm nREPL.
;; Neither owns the discovery rule, so the two cannot disagree about which
;; files are suites — the failure mode where a suite runs in the REPL and not
;; in the gate (or the reverse) is structurally unavailable.
;;
;; Strata, in order: `files` COLLECTS (the only form that reads the
;; filesystem), `ns-of` / `namespaces` PROMOTE (pure, over values), and
;; `load-all!` is the BOUNDARY (the only form that mutates the runtime by
;; requiring). Callers that want the list without loading anything stop at
;; Promote.
