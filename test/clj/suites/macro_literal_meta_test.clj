;; [CLJW-MACRO-LITERAL-META]: reader metadata on a collection literal must
;; survive macroexpansion.
;;
;; A macro's return value is a runtime Value, and the analyzer converts it back
;; into a Form (`analyzer.valueToForm`) so it can be re-analyzed. That
;; converter rebuilt a collection from its ELEMENTS only and never read the
;; Value's metadata, so `^:a []` came back stripped. The `.symbol` arm had
;; carried symbol meta across since ADR-0110; collections were missed.
;;
;; The bug is invisible to a direct `cljw -e` or a loaded .clj file, because
;; nothing there round-trips through a macro return. It shows up in exactly one
;; place: inside a macro body. Since every `clojure.test` assertion sits inside
;; `deftest`/`testing`, it made correct functions fail their own upstream suite
;; while passing every hand probe. `clojure.core-test.group-by` reported 6
;; failures whose expressions all pass outside the harness; the function was
;; never at fault.
;;
;; clj preserves the metadata in both positions, so these are parity
;; assertions, not cljw inventions. Checked against Clojure 1.12.4.
