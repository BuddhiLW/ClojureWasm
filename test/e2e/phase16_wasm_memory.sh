# test/e2e/phase16_wasm_memory.sh — the (ptr,len) linear-memory surface
# (ADR-0192). `wasm/call` marshals scalars, which reaches every guest whose
# whole interface fits in numbers; a numeric guest's does not. This asserts the
# host can fill the buffer a guest's pointer argument names and read what the
# guest wrote back, that every element type round-trips through the wasm memory
# model (little-endian, unaligned-tolerant, i64 exact past the i48 window), and
# that every failure is a catchable exception rather than a host panic.
#
# OPT-IN for the same reason as phase16_wasm_ffi.sh: it builds `-Dwasm`, so it
# resolves zwasm, which the default gate never does (F-001).
