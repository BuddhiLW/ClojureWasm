#
# A rejection caused by BAD DATA must be catchable.
#
# cljw's `not_implemented` Kind is deliberately uncatchable, so that an
# unsupported feature cannot be quietly swallowed by a `(catch Throwable …)`.
# That is right for an unsupported feature and wrong for bad input: a program
# that parses untrusted JSON, or calls a function with an argument of the wrong
# type, must be able to handle the rejection — JVM Clojure throws a catchable
# exception in every case below, so a `(try … (catch Throwable …))` that works
# on clj must work here.
#
# Found on the ClojureWasm playground: /api/eval answered 500 to a malformed
# request body, because the handler's `(catch Throwable _ …)` could not fire —
# `cljw.json/decode` raised `not_implemented` for a JSON syntax error.
#
# Each case below was verified against the `clj` oracle to be `:caught` there.
# To find more candidates, list the uncatchable raise sites and ask of each
# whether it rejects a FEATURE or a VALUE:
#
#     grep -rn 'raise(\.feature_not_supported' src/
#
# `enumeration-seq` / `iterator-seq` are the counter-example: cljw has no Java
# Enumeration, so those genuinely are unsupported features and stay uncatchable.
