# D-447 close-out: the regex gaps are either IMPLEMENTED (lookbehind, named
# groups, \A \z \Z, nested class unions + && intersection, empty alternatives)
# or PERMANENTLY DECLINED (backreferences — AD-060, the RE2 posture: a
# backreference forces a backtracking engine, and ADR-0031's Pike-NFA
# linear-time guarantee is the property that lets untrusted patterns run).
#
# The implemented half is clj-byte-matched in
# test/diff/clj_corpus/regex_equivalence.txt (15 goldens appended 2026-08-05);
# this file pins the SIGNAL SPLIT, which the corpus cannot express:
#   - a MALFORMED pattern raises the CATCHABLE invalid-pattern error
#     (Java: PatternSyntaxException, catchable), and
#   - a VALID-in-Java backreference raises the UNCATCHABLE unsupported-feature
#     error that a (catch Throwable …) must NOT swallow.
