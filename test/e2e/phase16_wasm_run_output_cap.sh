# `(wasm/run …)` buffers the guest's stdout and stderr in HOST memory, and
# neither of the other two budgets bounds that: fuel bounds instructions, and
# how many bytes an instruction writes is the guest's choice. Measured before
# the cap existed: `spam_stdout.wasm` buffered exactly 64,000,000 bytes for
# 1,000,000 fuel — 64 bytes per unit — so ~64 GB under the default fuel budget.
# A 1e8-fuel run reached ~6.4 GB RSS; with the cap it peaks at ~33 MB.
#
# The guest IGNORES fd_write's errno, so this holds against a guest that does
# not cooperate with the cap.

# Fuel is chosen per case for COST, not for coverage: the guest produces 64
# bytes per unit of fuel, so a run's wall time is proportional to the volume it
# would produce uncapped. 1e6 fuel (64 MB) costs ~60 s, and four of those made
# this the most expensive step in the gate — so each case uses the least fuel
# that still exceeds the cap it is testing.
