# test/e2e/phase16_wasm_component_multiexport.sh — D-567 / D-404.
#
# cljw's headline feature is "require a Wasm component as a namespace". A
# namespace with one function is not a namespace, and until 2026-08-04 nobody
# had checked: both component fixtures then in the tree (greet,
# resource_counter) export exactly one function, so a component with TWO
# exports had never been loaded. It did not load — zwasm rejected any component
# with >= 2 exports with `InvalidSort`, engine-side (zwasm D-527, fixed in
# zwasm #157).
#
# This file used to PIN that gap. It now asserts what the gap was hiding: the
# ADR-0135 marshalling table, driven through the 16-export typed fixture in
# BOTH directions. That is what discharges D-404's "BLOCKED on a typed
# component FIXTURE" — the fixture exists and every row it covers runs here.
#
# Provenance + rebuild recipe for the fixtures: fixtures/wasm/README_echo.md.
