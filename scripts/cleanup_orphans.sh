# cleanup_orphans.sh — reap this repo's long-lived orphaned test processes.

#   bash scripts/cleanup_orphans.sh --dry-run

# Wired as a SessionStart hook so a session that was interrupted mid-gate does
# not leave a core spinning until the machine is noticed (the 2026-05-28
# incident in ADR-0049 § Context: an orphaned REPL pipeline spun ~1h50m).
# `scripts/run_gate.sh reap` covers the same ground WITHIN a session; this is
# the ACROSS-session backstop.
#
# History: `.claude/rules/orphan_prevention.md` and `.dev/reference_clones.md`
# both cited `~/.claude/hooks/cleanup_orphans.sh` as the live reaper. That file
# did not exist on the maintainer machine and could not exist on anyone else's
# — it was outside the repo, so cloning never brought it. An orphan guarantee
# nothing implements is worse than no guarantee, because the disciplines
# elsewhere ("background long-runners are backstopped") were written assuming
# it. Shipping it in-repo makes the claim true for every clone (D-565 item 3).
#
# Safety: a process is eligible only when it is orphaned (PPID 1) AND older
# than AGE_MIN minutes AND matches one of the test-machinery shapes below. An
# interactive `cljw` REPL the user is typing into has a real parent, so it is
# never touched.
#
# Scope, stated honestly: `bash test/run_all.sh` appears in `ps` with a
# RELATIVE path, so a sibling checkout's orphaned gate is indistinguishable
# from ours and would also be reaped. That is deliberate and matches the
# precedent — in the 2026-05-28 incident it was the sibling zwasm session that
# reaped this repo's orphan (ADR-0049 § Context). A `cljw` binary is matched by
# absolute path, so that one IS repo-scoped.
