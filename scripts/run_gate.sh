#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/run_gate.sh — single-gate launcher with orphan reaping.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Re-running the full Mac gate (`bash test/run_all.sh`) — especially when
# a *premature* task-completion notification leads to starting a new gate
# while an old one is still at its e2e step — stacks `run_all.sh` process
# trees. Each tree forks e2e sub-shells + `cljw -e` large-input probes
# (e.g. `(count (interleave (range 50000) …))`). When a gate is killed or
# times out, its `cljw` children **re-parent to PID 1 and keep running**,
# so the pile drives load to 10–17 and garbles tool output. (Incident
# 2026-05-31; see `.claude/rules/orphan_prevention.md` + memory
# `premature-gate-notification`.) The SessionStart `cleanup_orphans.sh`
# only reaps at etime > 30 min — far too long for a ~50 s gate.
#
# WHAT IT DOES — makes "one gate at a time, no orphans" structural:
#   1. Reap any PRIOR `test/run_all.sh` tree (TERM then KILL).
#   2. Reap `cljw` probes orphaned to PID 1 (re-parented when their gate
#      died) — precise: ppid==1 only, so a live gate's children and any
#      legitimate interactive `cljw` are untouched.
#   3. Run exactly ONE gate under a bounded timeout (default 2700 s). The
#      bound exists to kill a STUCK gate, so it must sit above what a healthy
#      one costs — "a bound that kills a healthy gate is worse than no bound:
#      it exits 0 through a pipeline and reads as a pass."
#
#      That is not hypothetical. The bound was 900 s, sized against a
#      "~350 s serial gate"; the suite has since grown past it, and 900 s
#      SIGTERMed healthy gates mid-e2e. Measured 2026-08-19 on the CI runners
#      — the same `--serial-e2e` configuration this launcher runs — the full
#      gate takes **1009 s (macOS) / 1491 s (Linux)** COLD. So the old default
#      could not complete a full gate on any host, and the kill presented as a
#      log that simply stopped. 2700 s is ~1.8x the slowest measured cold run:
#      above every healthy gate, still far below "wait forever".
#
#      Re-derive this number whenever the gate's cost changes materially; a
#      stale bound here fails silently, which is the worst way to fail.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/run_gate.sh                 # reap + run one gate
#   bash scripts/run_gate.sh --only foo      # args pass through to run_all.sh
#   bash scripts/run_gate.sh reap            # reap orphans only, no gate
#   GATE_TIMEOUT=420 bash scripts/run_gate.sh   # override the bound
#
# `.dev/.gate_pass` / `.dev/.gate_cadence` are written by run_all.sh
# itself, so `check_gate_cadence.sh` authorises commits exactly as before.

# CO-TENANCY: this reap must only ever touch processes belonging to THIS
# checkout. `pgrep -f 'test/run_all.sh'` matches every gate on the machine, and
# the command line is relative (`bash test/run_all.sh --serial-e2e`), so the
# pattern alone cannot tell one worktree from another. It used to kill them all.
#
# Measured 2026-08-19: a peer session's `--smoke`, running in a sibling git
# worktree of this repo, was TERMed then KILLed the moment a gate started here.
# It died with zero bytes of output — a signal death flushes nothing — and read
# as a mysterious `exit 144`. The peer attributed it to CPU contention and to
# having broken the "the full gate runs ALONE" rule. It was neither: that rule
# is about load, and no amount of obeying it protects you from another
# checkout's `pkill`.
#
# So every candidate is filtered by its working directory. Same for the orphan
# `cljw` sweep: that one is additionally guarded by ppid==1, which spared the
# peer's long-running MCP servers — but by luck, not by design. A daemonized
# process is one `nohup` away from matching, and killing a teammate's server is
# not something to leave to luck.
