# Decision 2026-09-11 (memory 20260911144411-22d9cd94): cljw tests are deftests
# in test/clj/suites/, not new bash e2e scripts. The rule was prose only and
# was broken twice in round 5 (test/e2e/phase16_compare_comparable.sh, added
# by a ling and then edited by the coordinator; migrated in ae0d8195). This
# check freezes the count so the next new script fails the gate instead of
# relying on someone remembering the rule.
#
# A test that genuinely has to cross a process boundary (exit codes, signals,
# stdin/stdout piping of the cljw binary itself) may still be a script: put the
# marker line
#     # e2e-process-boundary: <one-line reason>
# in it and it is not counted. Every other script counts against BASELINE.
#
# When you migrate a script to a suite and the count drops, lower BASELINE in
# the same commit (the check prints the new number). Never raise it.
#
#   bash scripts/check_e2e_count.sh
#   E2E_DIR=/tmp/x bash scripts/check_e2e_count.sh   # self-test on a scratch dir
#
# bash 3.2 compatible (the macOS host runs the system bash).
