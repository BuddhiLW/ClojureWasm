#
#   bash scripts/check_gate_parity.sh
#
# `scripts/ci_gate.sh` says, in its own header, "FULL gate == the LOCAL full
# gate … (test/run_all.sh --serial-e2e)". That sentence was false for months:
# `ci_gate.sh` passed `--serial-e2e`, `run_gate.sh` passed nothing, and
# `run_all.sh` defaults to `PARALLEL_E2E=1`. So "the local full gate is green"
# and "CI is green" were statements about two different test runs.
#
# It is not a theoretical gap. The parallel path captures each job's output to a
# file; the serial path pipes it. An e2e whose producer took SIGPIPE from a
# `head -N` therefore died silently under serial and passed under parallel —
# green on every local full gate, red on every push (2026-08-04).
#
# Two launchers can stay, but their agreement has to be executed rather than
# asserted in a comment. That is the whole content of this check.
#
# 2026-08-12: extended from "both pass --serial-e2e" to "there is exactly ONE
# configuration". CI used to run tiers — PR got `--smoke`, the nightly got the
# full gate PLUS a tree_walk sweep of corpus + every e2e — so three different
# runs could each be called green. The nightly's last run failed on a 5-second
# wall-clock bound in that extra config and nowhere else; the same bind measures
# 0.08-0.14 s locally on the same build, so the tier's only finding was about
# the runner. Tiers are gone, and the checks below make their return a gate
# failure rather than a review-time thing to notice.
