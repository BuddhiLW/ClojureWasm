# binary_size_report.sh — binary-size measurement + size-claims gate (ADR-0172).
#
# Report mode (default):
#   bash scripts/binary_size_report.sh [BIN]
#     Prints total bytes + the segment/section breakdown for BIN
#     (default zig-out/bin/cljw). With a symbol-bearing binary
#     (-Dprofile=true build), also prints the top code symbols so a
#     size jump localizes to a component (the ADR-0172 method).
#
# Gate mode:
#   bash scripts/binary_size_report.sh --check [BIN]
#     Checks EVERY "<N> MB" figure in every file listed in SIZE_CLAIM_FILES
#     against BIN's measured size. Fails (exit 1) when any of them drifts
#     more than 10%. A figure that is deliberately NOT the shipped size
#     (babashka's binary, the ReleaseSmall floor, a historical row) must
#     carry an inline `<!--size:other-->` marker on the same line — so the
#     exemption is explicit and greppable, never silent.
#     Wired into test/run_all.sh as the `size_claims` step (full gate;
#     runs right after build_cljw so the binary is fresh).
#
#     History: the check originally read ONLY README.md's first MB figure.
#     The 2026-08-04 audit found that docs/landscape.md ("~3 MB", 2.4x
#     under) and bench/RELEASE_METRICS.md (a table saying 6.97 MB with
#     prose two paragraphs below still claiming 3.24 MB) had both rotted
#     precisely because nothing checked them — the same shape as zwasm's
#     2026-08-03 `ungated-negative-doc-claim-rotted-into-a-lie` lesson.
#     Every public size claim is gated now.
#
# Reference platform for ADR-0172 numbers: macOS arm64, ReleaseSafe,
# -Dwasm, stripped (= the brew artifact config). MB here is decimal
# (10^6 bytes), matching what brew/GitHub display to users.

# ADR-0172 §2 derived ceiling (per-component budgets sum). Keep in sync with
# the ADR's budget table — a change here REQUIRES an ADR-0172 Revision
# history entry (the budget moves consciously, never to silence this check).
#
# Denominated in REFERENCE-PLATFORM bytes, because that is what the budget
# table measures: ADR-0172 §1 names macOS arm64 as the reference for "every
# number in this ledger". See PLATFORM_SIZE_FACTOR below for why enforcing
# this number as an absolute on every host was a latent contradiction.
BUDGET_CEILING_BYTES=8800000

# The same source builds measurably bigger off the reference platform, so a
# ceiling derived from mac-denominated component budgets cannot be applied to
# a Linux artifact as an absolute — that compares two different things, which
# is the same error this script already avoids for the claim-drift check.
#
# ADR-0172 §1 states the expectation as "within ~±15%". The two mac/Linux
# pairs its Revision history actually records are tighter and agree with each
# other: 7,073,240 B / ~8.01 MB = 1.132, and 7,352,376 B / ~8.29 MB = 1.128.
# 1.13 is that measured ratio, not the ±15% envelope — the envelope would be
# the looser choice and there is no reason to spend it.
#
# This is a correction, NOT a relaxation: the reference-platform ceiling is
# unchanged at 8,800,000 B, so the budget does not move where it was derived.
# It only stops a Linux run from being measured against a number that was
# never in Linux bytes. The ADR's own Revision history shows the contradiction
# accumulating — Linux recorded at "91% of ceiling", then "94% of ceiling",
# against a ceiling mac was at ~80% of — and it reached 100.01% on
# 2026-08-14, failing the gate on 1,032 bytes.
