# scripts/check_entrypoint_surface.sh — CLI entry-point classpath parity guard.
#
# Born from Discussion #13: D-322 landed filesystem-classpath resolution on the
# terminal REPL, and `cljw nrepl` was not carried along — the one entry point
# where the user is CERTAIN to be on a project was the only one that could not
# `(require '[my.lib])`. The bug class is "a new (or overlooked) entry point
# silently misses the shared classpath contract". This guard makes that class
# fail the gate instead of waiting for a field report:
#
#   1. Extract the subcommand set from src/app/cli.zig's dispatch
#      (`std.mem.eql(u8, first, "<name>")`).
#   2. Two-sided set equality against the lists below — an EXTRA subcommand
#      (someone added one) and a MISSING subcommand (someone renamed/refactored
#      the dispatch idiom) both fail, forcing a conscious decision here.
#   3. Every EVAL subcommand's dispatch branch must reach the shared classpath
#      resolution (resolveClasspath / resolveDefaultClasspath / splitClasspath).
#   4. The default (non-subcommand) path — dispatchArgsRest — must too.
#   5. A vacuous extraction (< MIN_SUBCOMMANDS) fails: if the dispatch idiom
#      changes, this script must be re-taught, not silently pass.
#
# Adding a subcommand: EVAL_SUBCOMMANDS if it evaluates user code (it must then
# call the shared resolver AND join the classpath e2e coverage —
# test/e2e/phase16_repl_classpath.sh / phase14_nrepl_classpath.sh /
# phase14_cljw_build.sh are the per-entry rung owners); EXEMPT_SUBCOMMANDS only
# if it never evaluates user code (say why in the list).
#
# Modes: no args = gate (exit 1 on violation). Runs in <1s; part of the
# per-commit smoke core.
