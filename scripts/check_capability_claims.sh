# check_capability_claims.sh — every "we can do X" claim carries a status marker
# whose PLANNED form names a live debt owner (ADR-0177).
#
#   bash scripts/check_capability_claims.sh          # gate mode (default)
#   bash scripts/check_capability_claims.sh --list    # show every marker found
#
# Two invariants, both fail-closed:
#
#   1. Every `<!--claim:planned:D-NNN-->` marker names a debt id that EXISTS
#      and is still OPEN in `.dev/debt.yaml` (`active:` or `standing:`). A
#      planned claim whose owner was discharged is a claim with nobody left to
#      build it — which is how "planned" quietly becomes "abandoned, still
#      advertised".
#   2. The forbidden-phrase list does not appear UNMARKED in a claim-bearing
#      document. These are phrases the 2026-08-04 audit found asserting, in the
#      present tense, capabilities that do not exist.
#
# Why this exists (ADR-0177 / the 2026-08-04 cross-project audit): ROADMAP §1.1
# stated "runs on Cloudflare Workers / Fastly / Fermyon Spin" as a fact while
# `build.zig` had no `wasm32` target at all, §1.2 axis 1 called a Wasm Component
# "a first-class output" that was never built, and §10.3 set a cold-start target
# for that nonexistent artifact. Every one of those sentences sat outside any
# gate. Its sibling `binary_size_report.sh --check` covers NUMERIC claims; this
# covers CAPABILITY claims. Together they are the answer to zwasm's
# `2026-08-03-ungated-negative-doc-claim-rotted-into-a-lie` lesson.
#
# Deliberately NOT a general English-prose checker: it is a fixed, curated
# phrase list plus a marker-integrity check. A heuristic "does this sentence
# claim a capability?" scanner over a 1600-line ROADMAP would false-positive
# constantly and get disabled, which is worse than no gate.
