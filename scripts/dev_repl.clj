;; scripts/dev_repl.clj — the cljw dev loop, in Clojure instead of bash.
;;
;; Runs under babashka. The protocol half (bencode + the nREPL exchange) lives
;; in scripts/dev/*.cljc and is SHARED with cljw — the same client code runs on
;; both runtimes, so using the loop dogfoods cljw's own socket/byte/UTF-8 stack:
;;
;;     bb  scripts/dev_repl.clj eval '(+ 1 2)'      # this file
;;     echo '(+ 1 2)' | CLJW_REPL_PORT=7899 \
;;         zig-out/bin/cljw scripts/nrepl_client.clj   # same .cljc, under cljw
;;
;; Babashka owns only the part cljw genuinely cannot express today: process
;; supervision. cljw has no process-spawn surface at all (no
;; clojure.java.shell/sh, no ProcessBuilder, no cljw.process), so start/stop
;; live here. If cljw grows that surface, this file can move over too.
;;
;; WHAT THE LOOP IS FOR (measured 2026-08-30, quiet machine, warm cache):
;;   redefine a var over nREPL ................... 0.13 s
;;   the same change through core.clj ............ ~400 s   (full bytecode regen)
;;   a .zig change (dual-backend test binaries) .. ~400-590 s
;; So: work out WHAT a clojure.core definition should be here — a `defn` in the
;; running image shadows the embedded one — then edit core.clj and pay the
;; rebuild ONCE.
;;
;; It is NOT for running the suites: cljw cold-starts in ~21 ms, which beats any
;; warm-image round trip. Run those directly:
;;     zig-out/bin/cljw -cp test/clj test/clj/run_suites.clj
;;
;; Usage:
;;   bb scripts/dev_repl.clj start|stop|status
;;   bb scripts/dev_repl.clj eval '(+ 1 2)'
;;   echo '(defn f [] 1)' | bb scripts/dev_repl.clj eval -
;;   bb scripts/dev_repl.clj test [suite-ns]
