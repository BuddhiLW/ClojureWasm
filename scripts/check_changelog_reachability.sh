#
# CHANGELOG.md is the release-history SSOT. Two ways it can lie:
#
# 1. A shipped release has no heading of its own. v1.14.9, v1.14.10 and
#    v1.14.11 appended their entries under `## [1.14.8]` and nothing noticed
#    (fixed by bba2e79f). Every `vX.Y.Z` tag reachable from HEAD, from v1.0.0
#    on, must have a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, and the newest tag's
#    heading must be the first one after `## [Unreleased]`.
#
# 2. `[Unreleased]` describes something that has already shipped. An entry
#    that is also present in the newest tag's own `[Unreleased]` section went
#    out in that release while still reading as forthcoming.
#
# Both need the release tags. A clone without them (CI's shallow checkout)
# reports that and passes; the local gate, which has the tags, is where
# this bites.
#
# Informational by default (exit 0). Pass --gate to exit 1 on a violation.
