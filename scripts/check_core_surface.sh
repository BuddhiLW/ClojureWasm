# cljw's `clojure.core` publishes 104 names JVM Clojure does not. They are not
# leaks: cljw has no Java, so where JVM Clojure exposes the `clojure.lang.*`
# INTERFACES a `deftype` implements, cljw exposes protocols and their `-name`
# methods (ADR-0007 Option beta / ADR-0059, the ClojureScript convention —
# `cljs.core/ISeq`, `cljs.core/-first`). They must be public for
# `(deftype Foo [] ISeq (-first [_] :a))` to compile.
#
# Why a gate: the 2026-08-04 audit read that surface as "internal helpers leaked
# into the public API" and drafted a cleanup that would have broken every
# `deftype` against a host interface — including
# `test/conformance/verified_projects/data.finger-tree`, which names
# Seqable/ISeq/IPersistentStack/Indexed explicitly. Nothing in the tree recorded
# the intent, so the misreading was reasonable. This file records it, and the
# gate makes the set exact: a NEW extra name is a conscious decision, and one
# that vanishes is a breaking change to a documented surface.
#
# Deliberately compares NAMES ONLY — not arities, not docstrings. It answers
# "what is in clojure.core that upstream does not have", nothing finer.
set -uo pipefail
# `sort`/`comm` collate byte-wise, so the ledger's order is the same on every
# machine and a regen under a different locale is not spurious drift.
