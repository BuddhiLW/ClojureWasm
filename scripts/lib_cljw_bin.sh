# Callers that MAY build do not belong here: they run `zig build` unconditionally
# (guarded by `CLJW_SKIP_BUILD` for the gate, which builds once up front), which
# is simpler than an mtime test and cannot be fooled by a checkout that rewrites
# timestamps. This file serves the callers for which building is WRONG — a bench
# harness or a project-verification run must measure the binary it was handed and
# say so when that binary does not match the tree.
#
# `find -newer` rather than `stat`: BSD and GNU `stat` disagree on the format
# flag, and the gate's primary host is macOS.
