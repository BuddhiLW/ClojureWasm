(ns wasm-percall
  "The per-crossing cost of one `wasm/call`, in nanoseconds
  ([CLJW-WASM-BENCH-BLIND], ADR-0196 D4).

  Every workload in bench/wasm_bench.sh loops INSIDE the module and crosses
  the cljw -> wasm boundary once per process, so a per-call cost of any size is
  invisible to it. This is the other axis: the loop is on the cljw side and
  only the calls are timed. One module, instantiated once per engine, warmed,
  then `trials` trials of `n` calls per cell; per cell the median, min, max and
  sample standard deviation over trials, in ns, never ms.

  Cells: auto | jit | interp on the runtime thread (`-main`) and on a worker
  (`-worker`, via `future`), plus `fn-call`: a plain Clojure function call in
  the same process. That last row is the platform constant, kept in its own
  datum key so a regression in cljw's call path is distinguishable from one in
  the engine. Copies the discipline of zwasm's own bench/latency runner.

  Run (needs a -Dwasm ReleaseSafe binary):
    ./zig-out/bin/cljw -cp bench -m wasm-percall [--n=20000] [--trials=7] [--yaml=FILE]

  ON-DEMAND ONLY (Layer 4 bench, never a gate step; a measurement is not an
  assertion). `--yaml` writes the datum bench_domain.py's from_wasm_percall reads."
