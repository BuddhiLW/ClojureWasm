"""Domain model for the benchmark tier, the CALCULATION stratum.

Pure: no I/O, no clock, no knowledge of Markdown or SVG. It owns one thing,
the vocabulary a benchmark result is expressed in, so no renderer re-derives it.

Stratification of `bench/`:

    boundary (actions)      bench/*.sh          spawn runtimes, read the clock,
                                                write the datum
    datum (data)            bench/*.yaml        inert, diffable, committed
    calculation (pure)      bench/*.py          datum -> Markdown, datum -> SVG

Ubiquitous language
-------------------
Workload      what is computed (`fib_recursive`, `sieve`). Has a KIND, because
              not every workload is comparable across every runtime.
Runtime       what computes it (`cw`, `python`, `wasmtime`). Has a FAMILY,
              because a script-vs-compiled gap is context, not a verdict.
Measurement   one (workload, runtime, mode) -> microseconds.
Suite         a machine + toolchain + date under which measurements are
              comparable. THE AGGREGATE ROOT: measurements from two Suites are
              not comparable and must never share a table or a chart. This is
              why a Linux dataset cannot "top up" a Mac one, it is a different
              Suite, not more rows.

Adapters (`from_cross_lang`, `from_wasm_ffi`) map a producer's YAML shape onto
the model. Renderers depend on the model, never on a YAML shape (DIP), so a
change to a harness's output touches exactly one adapter.

# a reference floor. TinyGo and Zig are intentionally absent: TinyGo is a Go
# variant whose role is the wasm comparison, and Zig, cljw's own
# implementation language, only restates the floor C already provides.
