;; dev/user.clj — the REPL-driven scratchpad.
;;
;; `user` is the namespace a Clojure REPL starts in, so everything here is
;; reachable the moment a REPL comes up with `dev` on the classpath:
;;
;;     zig-out/bin/cljw nrepl --port 7899 -cp src:test:test/clj:dev
;;     bb scripts/dev_repl.clj eval '(user/run-all)'
;;
;; Nothing in this file is loaded by the gate, and nothing the gate depends on
;; may be DEFINED here — `dev/` is scratch, `test/` is the contract. The
;; discovery rule is deliberately not re-implemented below; it is required from
;; `harness.suites`, the same namespace `test/clj/run_suites.clj` runs on, so a
;; suite cannot pass here and be invisible to the gate.
;;
;; WHY A WARM IMAGE AT ALL. Measured 2026-08-30 (quiet machine, warm cache):
;; redefining a var over nREPL costs 0.13 s, the same change through core.clj
;; costs ~400 s (full bytecode regen), and a .zig change costs ~400-590 s. So
;; the loop is: work out WHAT a definition should be here, where a `defn` in
;; the running image shadows the embedded one, then edit the real file and pay
;; the rebuild ONCE.
;;
;; The suites themselves do NOT need this image — cljw cold-starts in ~21 ms,
;; which beats a warm round trip. Reach for `run-all` when you are iterating on
;; a definition, not when you just want the tier green.
