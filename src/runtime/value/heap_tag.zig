//! Stored in `HeapHeader.tag` on every heap-allocated object and also
//! encoded as a 4-bit sub-type within heap-tagged Values (combined with
//! the 2-bit group band per ADR-0027 §1). Per ADR-0012 + ADR-0027 the

//! The layout is the g2 64-entry namespace (4 group × 16 sub-type) per

//! descriptor dispatch tables in `runtime/gc/tag_ops.zig` carry `null`
//! for tags whose owning Phase has not yet wired behaviour (the `null`
//! entry is the safe leaf-node default — see `tag_ops.zig`).

//
// The 2026-08-04 audit counted the 64 names below and concluded the tag space
// was "100% full — a new type has nowhere to go, and only a user F-004
// amendment can unblock it". Names are not uses. Measured by use, 11 of the 64
// addresses are not doing NaN-box work, and no F-004 amendment is required to
// see that.
//
// Getting this census right took three attempts, all of them the same class of
// error as the audit's, so the classification is enforced here rather than
// described:
//
//   - a COMPUTED-tag encode site was missed by a syntactic grep
//     (`map.zig` encodes trie nodes via `@enumFromInt(n.header.tag)`), which
//     wrongly moved `hamt_map_node` out of the boxed set;
//   - a TEST-ONLY encode was counted as production, which wrongly kept
//     `wasm_funcref` / `wasm_externref` in it;
//   - the three counts summed to 63, not 64 — `@"volatile"` uses Zig's `@"…"`
//     escape and the pattern did not match it.
//
// `assertCensusCloses` below fails the build on the third class directly, and
// `boxable` makes the first class a compile error at the call site.

/// Tags that exist ONLY as a `HeapHeader.tag` — GC-traced heap objects that are
/// never encoded into a `Value`, so they consume no NaN-box sub-type address in
/// practice. `PersistentVector.tail` is a raw `?*TailNode` field; `TVal` is
/// reached only through `Ref.tvals` (`stm/tval.zig` states the invariant in its
