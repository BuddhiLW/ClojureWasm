//! Future — Tier A single-shot off-thread computation (Phase B #4b).
//!
//! `(future expr)` → `(__future-call (fn* [] expr))` → `alloc`, which spawns a
//! REAL OS thread (`std.Thread`) that runs the thunk and caches the result.
//! `(deref f)` BLOCKS on an `Io.Mutex`+`Io.Condition` result cell until the
//! worker realises the Future, then returns the cached value. This matches JVM
//! Clojure's fire-and-wait timing (the thread is kicked at construction; deref
//! waits for it).
//!
//! GC safety (ADR-0090 Alt B / D-244): the worker runs on the VM (the bytecode
//! `callFn` path on the VM-default build, F-012 / Q2) and registers a
//! `ThreadGcContext` so its operand-stack + binding roots are published — a
//! concurrent collect parks it at a safe point and walks its roots. The Future
//! is `gc.pin`ned for the worker's lifetime so a fire-and-forget
//! `(future (side-effect))` is not swept while the worker still writes to it;
//! the worker unpins on completion. The thread is detached — the result cell's
//! condition (not a join) synchronises `deref` (shutdown-orphan of a still-
//! running worker is a known limitation, tracked as a Phase-B follow-up).
//!
//! Exceptions: a thunk that throws is caught on the worker; `deref` returns
//! `null` and the caller (stm.zig `derefFn`) raises `future_thunk_failed`
//! (precise error attribution across the thread boundary is the D-115
//! Value-carried exception channel, still PROVISIONAL).
//!
//! Per F-009 the implementation is namespace-neutral.
