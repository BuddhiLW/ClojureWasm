//! EvalBudget — an in-process bound on ONE EVALUATION's execution (ADR-0125):
//! a step ceiling (deterministic, dual-backend-testable) AND/OR a wall-clock
//! deadline (the real untrusted-code bound). Both axes are optional; an
//! unmetered evaluation (no current budget) is the default and costs one
//! threadlocal load + branch per poll.
//!
//! **The budget follows the work, not the thread** (D-571). It is a refcounted
//! heap object; the evaluating thread holds it in the threadlocal `current`,
//! and every spawner (`Thread.` / `future` / an agent send) captures a
//! reference at spawn time so the spawned work is metered by the SAME budget —
//! the same absolute deadline, the same shared step counter. A worker that
//! outlives the `with-budget` extent keeps its reference and trips on it; it
//! cannot escape by outliving the extent, and a submission cannot escape the
//! step bound by moving its loop onto a spawned thread. The predecessor was a
//! non-atomic `?EvalBudget` slot on the Runtime: workers raced the main
//! thread's counter while the extent was live and found null after it exited.
//!
//! Polled at the back-edge safe points of BOTH backends (VM + TreeWalk) so a
//! non-allocating infinite loop is caught either way. On expiry it raises an
//! UNCATCHABLE `resource_exhausted` error (kindToHostClass→null): untrusted
//! code cannot swallow its own timeout via `(try … (catch Throwable …))`.
//! Once tripped it LATCHES — every subsequent poll on ANY thread re-raises —
//! so a straight-line burst after the (uncatchable) raise cannot make progress.
//!
//! F-006: the wall-clock read goes through the injected `io` (Runtime.io),
//! never a global clock.
//!
//! Backend: impl-only
//! Impl deps: none
//! Clojure peer: none (armed via CLJW_EVAL_MAX_STEPS / CLJW_EVAL_DEADLINE_MS
//!   or scoped via `cljw.eval/with-budget`)
