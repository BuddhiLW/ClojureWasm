//! A one-shot "it happened" edge that a waiter can wait on with a DEADLINE.
//!
//! Every blocking primitive cljw has waits for the same thing: a fact that is
//! false, becomes true once, and is never false again — a future is realised, a
//! promise is delivered, a thread is done, a cancel is requested. That is a
//! latch, and `std.Io.Event` is exactly a latch.
//!
//! These were all built on `std.Io.Condition`, which has no timed wait. That
//! shaped two things it should not have: the timed `deref` polled `isRealised`
//! in 1 ms sleeps, and every bound cljw wanted to place on a blocking call had
//! to be approximated by slicing a sleep. `std.Io.Event.waitTimeout` is the
//! timed wait, and `Io.Timeout` carries an absolute `.deadline`, so neither
//! approximation is needed.
//!
//! The mutex stays where a latch has a PAYLOAD (the future's value, the
//! promise's value): the mutex guards the payload, the latch carries the edge.
//! Order matters — publish the payload under the mutex, THEN `signal`. `set`
//! releases prior writes, so a waiter that observes the latch observes the
//! payload (`std.Io.Event.set`'s own documented guarantee).
//!
//! `waitTimeout` returns `error.Timeout` on a SPURIOUS wakeup as well as a real
//! one, so `wait` re-checks against its own absolute deadline rather than
//! trusting the return. That is why the deadline is passed as an instant and
//! not as a duration: a duration would restart on every spurious wakeup.
